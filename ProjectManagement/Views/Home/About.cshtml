        <h2>Our Story</h2><div class="row-fluid container"><div class="span6"><p>The seeds of Inventify germinated at the UET as the future students built places to share their projects, connect with others, and make an impact on the world. One of these early places was a blog Spikotech, which was an open source software experiment for LMS. Here they documented their hand-sewn kites, plywood boards, and other general mayhem that happens when PhDs and high winds collide.</p><p class="quoted">As a result of freely sharing our work, we met a ton of great people, received great opportunities, and were smacked in the face with the need for a web-based documentation system.</p></div><div class="span6"><p>Inventify became that documentation system in 2020, as an in-house project of UET Labs. When they weren't solving interesting problems like solar panels for driveways, efficiently harnessing human power, or strain sensing ropes, you could find them sharing Instructables from the workshop. From cooking to 3d printing, to making just about anything fly, Instructables became the recipient of countless hours of tinkering, soldering, stitching, frying, and fun, making just about anything.</p><p>Instructables was officially spun out of Squid Labs in the summer of 2020, and has gone on to grow from a modest hundreds of projects to over one hundred thousand. The community that now calls the site home, is an amazing mix of wonder from around the world.  Every day we continue to be amazed by the imagination, curiosity, and simple awesomeness of everyone who shares their creations with us on Inventify.</p></div></div><div id="about-slideshow">
